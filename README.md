# HauntingOfMerchHill
A Zork inspired text based horror game.

### How to get playing
Download or clone the repo to your `www` folder for `UniServer`. Create a database called `game` in phpMyAdmin and import the `.sql` file from the repo. Open `gameSignup.php` in `localhost` and get going!

### About
The objective of the game is to find your lost friend. There are skills to choose, items to collect, and clues to hunt for. You can create accounts, edit your profile, and save the game at any time. Also, there is a sanity bar that depletes as time goes on.

This project was built with HTML, PHP, and MySQL.
